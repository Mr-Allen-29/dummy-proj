The provided HTML code is for the frontend and doesn't directly require a Node.js backend to function. However, to create a fully functional online examination system, you'll need a backend server built with Node.js or another technology. Here's a general outline of how a Node.js backend could complement your frontend:

Node.js Backend Responsibilities:

User Management:
User registration (Student, Teacher, Admin)
Login and authentication
User data storage (using a database like MongoDB)
Exam Management:
Create and manage exams (including questions, time limits)
Store exam data (using a database)
Exam Delivery:
Serve exams to students based on their login
Evaluate exam responses
Store results (using a database)
Communication:
Handle communication between students, teachers, and admins (potentially using websockets)
Implementing the Backend:

Node.js Setup:

Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
Initialize a project directory and create a file named server.js for your main backend logic.
Dependencies:

Use npm to install required packages like Express.js (web framework), body-parser (parses request bodies), and a database library like Mongoose (for MongoDB interaction).
Server and Routing:

In server.js, create an Express server instance.
Define routes for user registration, login, exam creation, exam retrieval, etc.
Database Interaction:

Use Mongoose to connect to your MongoDB database.
Create models for users, exams, questions, and results.
Implement functions to interact with the database for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on this data.
Authentication:

Implement a secure mechanism for user login using libraries like bcrypt for password hashing.
Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to manage user sessions.
Connecting Frontend and Backend:

Use AJAX calls from your frontend Javascript code to interact with the Node.js backend APIs defined in your routes.
Send and receive data (user credentials, exam requests, responses) in JSON format.
Additional Considerations:

Secure your application by implementing proper authorization and validation checks.
Handle errors and edge cases gracefully.
Consider user interface design for the backend functionalities (admin panels, teacher dashboards etc.)
